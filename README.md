About Inception NetV3 Model:

1.InceptionV3 is a convolutional neural network architecture that belongs to the Inception family of models. It was introduced by Google researchers in the paper titled "Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision," which aimed to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of deep neural networks. InceptionV3 is an extension of its predecessors, Inception and InceptionV2 (also known as GoogLeNet).

2.InceptionV3 is a relatively deep network with 48 layers.

3.Here InceptioNetV3 model is used as the feature extractor.
